# SEEK

SEEK is an annual robotics hackathon, hosted by Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX), a club at U of T. It is primarily directed at participants with little to no experience with robotics. It aims to give them practical experience with robotics technologies as well as design experience with an interdisciplinary mindset. Past competitions have challenged competitors to build robots to perform a simulated search-and-rescue mission, navigate hazardous terrain and retrieve precious minerals. This year's competition will take place in mid-November. 

We are also looking to hold a similar competition, SEEK Jr., for high school students, with more of an emphasis on training beforehand. This will take place during reading week in February.
