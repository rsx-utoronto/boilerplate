# Club Description
### Describes our club, its projects and how we've grown

RSX is a student design team with a focus on robotics in space applications. Founded in 2013 (?) with five members, it now counts thirty between its mechanical, electrical and software teams. The members range from first year to grad school in many engineering disciplines.

Its first and largest project is to design and build a rover to complete a variety of tasks simulating what a Mars rover would do. This effort culminates in an annual competition in Utah with dozens of universities from around the world.

It has since taken on other projects within its scope of space robotics. These include a CanSat competition to build a glider launched from a rocket that takes atmospheric readings during a controlled descent. It also hosts SEEK, a hackathon for high school and university students, in which competitors build RC robots to complete a task.
