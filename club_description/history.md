# Club History
### Expanded club description with an emphasis on history and breadth of what we do
*Written for engsoc to describe us to external organizations*

Robotics for Space Exploration (RSX) is a student design team with a focus on developing robotics to further the exploration of Space. Founded in 2013 with five members, it now counts more than forty members from a diverse set of backgrounds. RSXâ€™s largest project is to design and build a Mars rover to complete a variety of tasks simulating the responsibilities of a tele-operated rover that would accompany astronauts on a manned mission to Mars. This effort culminates in an annual competition called the University Rover Challenge (URC) which takes place in the barren deserts of Utah. At the URC, RSX competes with over 80 teams from 13 different countries. Over the past three years, as RSX has grown as a student team within the University of Toronto, the URC has also grown substantially as a competition, rapidly increasing from 25 competing teams to over 80. Last year at the URC, our most recent year at the competition, RSX placed 14th out of the registered 62 teams despite an unfortunate and unpredictable electrical systems failure, which was certainly an impressive achievement. For the past two years, RSX has also grown to develop a new sub-team which has a slightly different focus. This team designs and builds a can-sized satellite to compete at the international CanSat competition which takes place annually in Texas. This competition allows our team to broaden our focus and provides our members with a greater variety of experience within the umbrella of space robotics. Our CanSat team has been extremely successful, placing eighth out of over 80 teams at the competition last year. RSX also takes on a variety of small scale projects to keep our members engaged throughout the year, such as our HabX project, in which a small team designed and built a scientific payload that we launched into the stratosphere using a helium-filled high altitude balloon and were able to track the payload on its way up, and on its descent back down to Earth. RSX also takes pride in engaging the Skule community at large, by organizing the popular annual Space Engineering and Exploration Kompetition (SEEK) where students participate in a single-day hackathon to design and build their own mini, Bluetooth controlled Mars Rovers. We also greatly emphasize spreading our enthusiasm of space and robotics to the youth of the city by participating in outreach events such as the Robots Rule event at the Ontario Science Center every year.
